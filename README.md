# Questscribe
(title is work in progress)

A simple DnD content viewer app.
It uses https://www.dnd5eapi.co/ as a database and simply displays the information.
But because making an http request every time is to slow a local copy of the database is shiped instead (Images are still downloaded though).
The easiest way to test this app at the moment is to clone the repository and open the project in gnome builder or simply install the .flatpak file.

NOTE: This project is not finished, there will be bugs.

If you have any suggestions or found any bugs, feel free to open an issue or a merge request!
